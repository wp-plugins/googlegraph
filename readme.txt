Plugin allows the blog authors to add simple but effective geo-chart, bar-charts or line graphs in their blogs using Google's Chart .js library.

== Description ==
Plugin that will allow the blog authors to add simple but effective geo-chart, bar-charts or line graphs in their blogs. 
The plug-in provides shortcodes for each chart type. The short codes can be placed anywhere in the text of the post/page
and the plug-in will render the chart in the place of the short code. The data for the chart is placed in form of table
insite the shortcode tag. For more details see the samples in the FAQ section.
The charts are based on Google's Javascript charts library, and the format of the data table is determined by the library itself.
For more details see the help pages of the Google Chart library.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the content of the ZIP archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use shortcodes in the text where you want the chart to appear
1. At the end, please write what you like about the plug-in in the review. :)

From version 0.3.2 we are adding a text with a link to our site under each graph. The text and link are wrapped in a paragraph
so you can easaly use CSS to hide the text from the page if you don't want the text to appear on your page.

Please address all your support questions in the "Support" part of the Wordpress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I don't see any amdin panels =
The plugin provides only shortcodes. The main idea for this plugin is to allow Editors and Contributors to create their own charts
inside their texts. At the moment, the shortcodes are created manualy. We are working on widget that will help users to graphicaly create
the shortcodes for the chrat.

= Why is the "Powered by" text appearing under the chart =
We had spend effort to create this plug-in and we are investing our time in improving it and incorporating your suggestions. We don't charge
for the non-commercial use of the plug-in, all we ask is from our users to share thier comments for improvement of the plug-in and to
attribute our work to us. If you want to make the text invisible, you are free to use CSS and set the paragrah's display attribute to "none".

= I am placing the shortcode in the text, but the chart doesn't appear on the page =
Most common reason for this problem are the HTML tags that the visual editor inserts in the text for the new line. If you have this problem
first remove all new lines (so the whole text of the shortcode will be in only one line). If the problem persists, swithc to "Text" view in the editor
and verify that there are no HTML tags between the start of the shortcode and the end of the shortcode.
In version 0.3.3, we had added explicit filter for the HTML tags inside the shortcode. If you expreriance this problem and you can not resolve it with the 
above steps, please send us the text (from the "Text" tab of the editor) and we will try to fix the problem for you.

= Geo Chart Example =
`[geoChart width="700px" height="700px" ]
	['Country', 'Popularity'],
	['Germany', 200],
	['United States', 300],
	['Brazil', 400],
	['Canada', 500],
	['France', 600],
	['RU', 700]
[/geoChart]`

Google geo chart supports the "markers" mode of display, and also allows you to specify the region of interest. We had exposed this functionality to the short code in order to achieve the following type of charts:

`[geoChart width="700px" height="700px" displaymode="markers" region="MK"]
	['City', 'Population', 'Area'],
	['Skopje', 2761477, 1285.31],
	['Bitola', 1324110, 181.76],
	['Prilep', 959574, 117.27],
	['Ohrid', 907563, 130.17],
	['Shtip', 655875, 158.9],
	['Gevgelija', 607906, 243.60],
	['Resen', 380181, 140.7],
	['Kriva Palanka', 371282, 102.41],
	['Kavadarci', 67370, 213.44],
	['Negotino', 52192, 43.43],
	['Tetovo', 38262, 11]
[/geoChart]`

We have also added the ability to control the colour gradient

`[geoChart width="700px" height="700px" colorstart="#e7711c" colorend="#4374e0"]
	['Country', 'Popularity'],
	['Germany', 200],
	['United States', 300],
	['Brazil', 400],
	['Canada', 500],
	['France', 600],
	['RU', 700]
[/geoChart]`

= Line Chart Example =

The line chart short is activated by a short code [  lineChart  ].

`[lineChart width="600px" height="500px" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 1 }" 
	vaxis="{title: '$k', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}" 
	curvetype="none"]
		['Year', 'Sales', 'Expenses'],
		['2004',  1000,      400],
		['2005',  1170,      460],
		['2006',  660,       1120],
		['2007',  1030,      540]
[/lineChart]`

We have also enabled the "function" rendering in order to create smooth curved line charts as in this example

`[lineChart curvetype="function" width="600px" height="500px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 1 }" 
	vaxis="{title: '$k', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}" 
	curvetype="function"]
		['Year', 'Sales', 'Expenses'],
		['2004',  1000,      400],
		['2005',  1170,      460],
		['2006',  660,  1120],
		['2007',  1030,      540]
[/lineChart]`

= Column Chart Example =

The column chart type is activated by a short code [  columnChart  ].

`[columnChart  width="500px" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $000', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Year', 'Sales', 'Expenses'],
		['2004', 1000, 400],
		['2005', 1170, 460],
		['2006', 660, 1120],
		['2007', 1030, 540]
[/columnChart]`

Adding a visual style to the columns is very easy and done as annotation on the data in the short code. Here is one example of styled columns

`[columnChart  width="300px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $000', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Year', 'Visitations', { role: 'style' } ],
		['2010', 10, 'color: gray'],
		['2010', 14, 'color: #76A7FA'],
		['2020', 16, 'opacity: 0.2'],
		['2040', 22, 'stroke-color: #703593; stroke-width: 4; fill-color: #C5A5CF'],
		['2040', 28, 'stroke-color: #871B47; stroke-opacity: 0.6; stroke-width: 8; fill-color: #BC5679; fill-opacity: 0.2']
[/columnChart]`

Columns can be stacked on top of each other in the following example

`[columnChart  width="500px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $M', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Period', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Genre', 'Fantasy & Sci Fi', 'Romance', 'Mystery/Crime', 'General','Western', 'Literature', { role: 'annotation' } ],
		['2010', 10, 24, 20, 32, 18, 5, ''],
		['2020', 16, 22, 23, 30, 16, 9, ''],
		['2030', 28, 19, 29, 30, 12, 13, ''],
[/columnChart]`

= Bar Chart Example =

The bar chart can be created by adding the short code [  barChart  ]

`[barChart  width="500px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $000', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Year', 'Sales', 'Expenses'],
		['2004', 1000, 400],
		['2005', 1170, 460],
		['2006', 660, 1120],
		['2007', 1030, 540]
[/barChart]`

The modified style

`[barChart  width="500px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $000', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Year', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Year', 'Visitations', { role: 'style' } ],
		['2010', 10, 'color: gray'],
		['2010', 14, 'color: #76A7FA'],
		['2020', 16, 'opacity: 0.2'],
		['2040', 22, 'stroke-color: #703593; stroke-width: 4; fill-color: #C5A5CF'],
		['2040', 28, 'stroke-color: #871B47; stroke-opacity: 0.6; stroke-width: 8; fill-color: #BC5679; fill-opacity: 0.2']
[/barChart]`

and the bars stacked / connected with each other

`[barChart  width="500px" stacked="1" 
	legend="{ position: 'top', maxLines: 2 }" 
	vaxis="{title: 'in $M', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}" 
	haxis="{title: 'Period', titleTextStyle: {color: 'blue'}}"]
		['Genre', 'Fantasy & Sci Fi', 'Romance', 'Mystery/Crime', 'General','Western', 'Literature', { role: 'annotation' } ],
		['2010', 10, 24, 20, 32, 18, 5, ''],
		['2020', 16, 22, 23, 30, 16, 9, ''],
		['2030', 28, 19, 29, 30, 12, 13, ''],
[/barChart]`

= Pie Chart Example =

The pie chart is triggered by short code [  pieChart  ]

`[pieChart width="400px" ]
	['Task', 'Hours per Day'],
	['Work',     11],
	['Eat',      2],
	['Commute',  2],
	['Watch TV', 2],
	['Sleep',    7]
[/pieChart]`

The position and color of the slices can be altered by adding the "slices" option to the shortcode as follows:

`[pieChart width="400px" slices="{ 0: {offset: 0.2, color: 'black'}, 3: {color: white} }"]
        ['Task', 'Hours per Day'],
        ['Work',     11],
        ['Eat',      2],
        ['Commute',  2],
        ['Watch TV', 2],
        ['Sleep',    7]
[/pieChart]`


At the moment we support only the basic pie chart, however we plan to add the 3D and Donut type soon.

= Bubble Chart Example =

To crate a bubble chart, you can use the [ bubbleChart ] short code as shown on the following example
 
`[bubbleChart width="400px" vaxis="{title: 'X', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}" haxis="{title: 'Y', titleTextStyle: {color: 'black'}}"  colorstart='yellow' colorend='red' bubble="{textStyle: {auraColor: 'none'}}"]
        ['ID', 'X', 'Y', 'Temperature'],
        ['a',   80,  167,      120],
        ['b',   79,  136,      130],
        ['c',   78,  184,      50],
        ['d',   72,  278,      230],
        ['e',   81,  200,      210],
        ['f',   72,  170,      100],
        ['g',   68,  477,      80]
[/bubbleChart]`

Bubble charts support classification (by color type) and size of the bubble. To add color class and size you will need to add two more columns to your data as shown on the example below:

`[bubbleChart width="600px" vaxis="{title: 'Fertility Rate'}" haxis="{title: 'Life Expectancy'}" bubble="{textStyle: {fontSize: 11}}" title="Correlation between life expectancy, fertility rate and population of some world countries (2010)"]
['ID', 'Life Expectancy', 'Fertility Rate', 'Region',     'Population'],
        ['CAN',    80.66,              1.67,      'North America',  33739900],
        ['DEU',    79.84,              1.36,      'Europe',         81902307],
        ['DNK',    78.6,               1.84,      'Europe',         5523095],
        ['EGY',    72.73,              2.78,      'Middle East',    79716203],
        ['GBR',    80.05,              2,         'Europe',         61801570],
        ['IRN',    72.49,              1.7,       'Middle East',    73137148],
        ['IRQ',    68.09,              4.77,      'Middle East',    31090763],
        ['ISR',    81.55,              2.96,      'Middle East',    7485600],
        ['RUS',    68.6,               1.54,      'Europe',         141850000],
        ['USA',    78.09,              2.05,      'North America',  307007000]
[/bubbleChart]`

= PHPLeague integration =

Since v0.4 we have added integration for the PHPLeague plugin, allowing you to create charts showing the statisics for the teams of the league.

We support two shortcodes, as follows:

* phpLeagueGraphPerCategory
* phpLeagueGraphPerTeam

You are not required to provide the table data for the chart, we are reading the data from the datbase and preparing it in the form suitable for the chart.

We support the following attributes on the shortcodes:

* league - The ID of the league for which the chart should be generated. By default this value is set to 1
* club_list - List of the clubs for the statistics. By default, we will generate graph with all clubs in the league.

`[phpLeagueGraphPerCategory league="2" /]

[phpLeagueGraphPerTeam/]

[phpLeagueGraphPerTeam league="1" club_list="1,2"/]`
